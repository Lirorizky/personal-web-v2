notes :

theres two imporant things that I realize :

  - the difference between placing the script inside the head
  and near the closing tag of the body.

  - following the dumbways tutorial on the ebook,
  where we get the documentById and put it inside a variable as a 
  global variable, the alert wont be triggered and we cant even see any console logs. IF we put the script inside the head. 

  - but once we move the script near the closing tag of the body,
  it will works like a charm.

  - this is because the difference in the time that it runs the script.
  the javascript will run first before the html body tag. which means
  any data catcher will get a null value. if its inside the head.

  - while the later, will run the html body first and then runs the script.

  BUT if we put the documentById inside the submitForm function, and
  catching the data with dataObject, there will be no problems in putting
  the script inside the head tag.

  this is because it will only be executed when the function is called
  which is through the onClick attribute on the submit button.
